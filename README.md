## What I've Worked On

### Flix Video Streamer

Flix was the first full MERN stack project I worked on. It was the end of my coding bootcamp, the assignment was to build a full stack MERN stack application, and I my group and I had a week to work on it. This project was a video streaming application that allowed users to create an account, login in, and be able to search for any video. The user will see multiple videos on the dashboad and also see a search button. Using the search button and typing anything a video will then pop up based on their search name. This application was built with React, Graphql, and CSS. It was my first time working on a real project with React as wel as Graphql, so it was a great learning experience. I had a great time working on this project and I think the team came together and did a great job.

One particular challenge I overcame during this project was deploying the application to heroku. Like I said, it was the first MERN stack application I worked on and I had never solo deployed an application to heroku before. After hours of trying and failing to deploy the application, agonizing over the idea of letting my group down, I finally figured out what I was doing wrong and was able to deploy the application on the evening of the due date. This project is 3 momths after I first wrote a line of code. I have come a lon way since then however the moment I successfully deployed the application to heroku was the moment I knew I could do this. I could be a web developer.

### Tasks: A Task Management Application

Tasks is a group project I worked on about midway through my coding bootcamp. The project is a task managment application that allows a user to create an account, login, create tasks, save tasks to the database, and delete tasks. The user can also mark tasks as complete, incomplete, and completed and assign users to teams. This frontend of this project was templated with Handlebars.js and styled with CSS. The backend of this project was built using express, nodejs, mysql, and sequelize.

I didn't touch the frontend of this project. I was tasked with building the architecture and structure of the repository, building the database, modeling with sequelize, routing, and authenctication. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and I'm super proud of it. We had 4 days to put this app together and orginally authentication was supposed to be one of the requirments. However since we didn't have time to go over authentication in class, my professor told us not to worry about it.

I decided to take it upon myself to learn how to implement authentication on this project. That was one of the best decisions I made in that course, not just because we successfully implemented the authentication, but because before this project I was having some trouble grasping REST API's and how to build them correctly. In order to implement the authentication I had to learn how REST API's work and how to build them correctly. I learned about how to use Insomnia and Postman for this project. I learned how to find a package and make it work after googling authentication npms and finding passport. I also took the lead on the github and project architecture on this project. Looking back on this I can't believe we pulled this off in the time we had. With the knowledge and experience level I had at the time. I'm really proud of this project.

### WriteMyReadme

WriteMyReadme was one of the first projects I used nodejs on. I was tasked with creating a CLI readme generator that would take in user input and generate a readme file. This project was a great learning experience for me. I learned how to install and use npm packages, how to use nodejs, and how to use the command line in general. I was surprsied by how much I enjoyed working on this project and how much I liked working with nodejs. I learned how to use the inquirer npm package, how to use the fs package, and how to use the command line. I also learned how to use markdown and how to write a readme file. This project was a great learning experience for me and I am proud of the work I did on it. Hop over to the repo and read the actual readme to install it and try it out. I think you will enjoy it.

### Yoran Imaging Website: JS/CSS Binary Matrix

This is an example from the agency I worked at as a web developer. I was tasked with building a business to business website for a customer using Wordpress and Oxygen Builder which was an unfamliar experience to me and the production site came out pretty good. I built the site from scratch with only a landing page design. I figured out a way to make the site look good and be responsive on all devices. While I was working on the project I learned how to use Oxygen Builder and Wordpress. What I want to show off is that I got the opportunity to do some really cool frontend work. There's a binary matrix on the page that wasn't in the design but I had the idea and my boss gave me the go ahead. All of the animations on the page were done by me as well. I'm proud of the work I did on this project under the circumstances and I think the site came out pretty good.

Here's a recording of the binary matrix I made:

## What I'm working on

Here's a teaser of what's to come from me. This is a project I started yesterday night. I'm not ready to go into too much detail about, but it's a hero built with Nextjs and Shadcn. I'm really excited about this project and I can't wait to show it off.
